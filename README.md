## FetchMyPendingPayout

This is a widget app that you can use to check your pending payout for your recent Steem post without ulocking your iPhone. 
It contains a simple ap and a widget. Add the widget by swiping left on your iPhone's main screen. 

#### The app will remember your username even when you exit. 
Your username will be there next time when you turn on the app.
#### Meanwhile, your widget will monitor your pending payout and it will refresh each time you visit it.  If the last post on your Steem blog page is some resteemed content, it will show the pending payout for that content you will be listed as a user and the author will be listed as an author.

This is my first time using custom frameworks, Steemjs API and pod "SwiftyJSON".
The app is free for using and personal modification. 
I will create a post about the app on Steemit.com and paste my link here.
#### Thank you!
